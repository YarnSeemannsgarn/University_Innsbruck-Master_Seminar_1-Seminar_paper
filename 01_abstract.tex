  \noindent In this seminar paper both the hardware and the software aspects of the delivery process of videos from YouTube are observed. For the hardware part the delivery infrastructure of Google and its load balancing capabilities through cache servers are explained. The software part in turn is dedicated to the software components of these servers, the scalibility techniques on the software side and the traffic management, when a user watches a video.\\
\\
It will be shown, that although especially the video web traffic gets bigger and the demands for the website of YouTube are constantly changing, the underlying delivery infrastructure and the applied software techniques will probably enable the handling of much more user actions on YouTube in the future.
